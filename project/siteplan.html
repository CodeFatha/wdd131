        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>The site helps users book a testdrive based on the car they want and not have to worry about where
            to find the car or who the dealer is. They simply get on the websitee, scroll through
            the collection of cars and click on the image of the care they want to test drive or 
            search it by name, fill in their information as well as the slot they want from the ones that
            are available and they will be redirected to dealerships near them who would also be 
            notified and would have to reserve the slot for them.</p>
