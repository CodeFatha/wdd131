            <p>14 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, 
                and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing 
                come upon you which was grievous to be borneâ€”and of all these things which 
                I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</p>

            <p>3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day 
                before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and the 
                Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed 
                with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.</p>
